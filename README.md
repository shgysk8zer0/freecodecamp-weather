FreeCodeCamp: Show the Local Weather

[![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Rzn2ch5.png)](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV)

1. [ ] **Objective**: Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/) app that is
functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.
2. [ ] **Rule #1**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
3. [ ] **Rule #2**: Fulfill the below [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story).
Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
4. [ ] **User Story**: I can see the weather in my current location.
5. [ ] **User Story**: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy
mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
6. [ ] **User Story**: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
7. [ ] **Note**: Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (`https://`)
connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason,
we recommend using HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the
freeCodeCamp Weather API https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me which uses an HTTP
Secure connection for the weather. Also, be sure to connect to
[CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/) via `https://`.
8. [ ] Remember to use [Read-Search-Ask](http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck/19514)
if you get stuck.
9. [ ] When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button
and include a link to your CodePen.
10. [] You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
